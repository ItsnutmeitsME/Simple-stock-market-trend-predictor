# Simple-stock-market-trend-predictor

**Overview:**

This project utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The goal is to provide a predictive model that can assist in making informed financial decisions by forecasting stock prices for the next 20 days.

**Original Problem:**

The original problem was to develop a model that can predict future stock prices using historical stock price data. Accurate prediction of stock prices is a significant challenge due to the volatility and complexity of the stock market. By leveraging RNNs, which are well-suited for sequence prediction problems, this project aims to create a reliable model for stock price prediction.

**Data Preparation:**

The dataset used in this project is historical stock price data, which is preprocessed and transformed into a suitable format for the RNN model. The data is normalized to ensure that the model training is efficient and effective. The data has been obtained from Yahoo Finance, meaning if the name of the stock is changed, the model would get the data of that stock, and the data of the previous 10 years.

**Results:**

The model achieved satisfactory results in predicting stock prices. Below is an example of the output graph, showing the actual and predicted stock prices:
